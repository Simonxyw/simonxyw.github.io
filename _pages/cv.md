Research Experience
-----
* **Jun. 2025 - Present**: Research Assistant, University of Michigan
  * **Mentor: Prof. Meha Jain**
  * **Project:** Evaluating agricultural burning regulations and crop calendar decisions in Punjab and Haryana, India.
    * Analyzed how monsoon variability and irrigation access influence residue burning and crop calendar deci-
sions in northern India using high-resolution panel data.
    * Integrated satellite, climate, and socio-economic datasets and applying fixed-effects and causal inference
models to quantify behavioral and policy responses.
    * Applied machine learning methods to identify spatial and socio-economic heterogeneity in adaptation.

* **Sept. 2024 - Present**: Research Assistant, Wuhan University
  * **Project:** Low-carbon land use and policy effectiveness in China.
    * Applied econometric modeling and machine learning to analyze the impacts of urban form and policy configurations on emissions and land use patterns.
    * Integrated remote sensing data with statistical analysis to construct city-level carbon emission indicators and evaluate policy effectiveness.
    * Contributed to the development of a horizontal carbon compensation policy framework to promote equitable cropland resource utilization.

* **Sept. 2024 - Apr. 2025**: Research Assistant, University of Wisconsin-Madison
  * **Mentor: Prof. Song Gao**
  * **Project:** Understanding the dynamic associations between COVID-19 infections and both human mobility and close contacts in New York State.
    * Conducted spatiotemporal COVID-19 analysis using statistical regression methods, Bayesian Change Point
Analysis, and spatially weighted models including GWR and GTWR.
    * Developed time-lagged models revealing contact behavior as a stronger predictor of case surges than mobility, highlighting socio-economic and urban-rural disparities in transmission patterns.
