About me
======
Hi! I'm Xinyu (Simon) Wu, a Master's student in Data Science at the University of Michigan, with a deep passion for Geospatial Data Science, Urban Informatics, and Sustainability. My academic and research background spans spatial data analysis, GIS, and policy analytics, with a keen interest in leveraging data-driven insights to improve urban planning, environmental sustainability, and equitable development.

I am particularly fascinated by how geospatial technologies and data science can inform policy, enhance civic analytics, and optimize land use planning. My previous internship experiences include working with large-scale spatial datasets, predictive modeling, and data visualization, helping organizations transform raw data into actionable insights for decision-making.

Beyond academics and research, I have a longstanding love for Cantopop (over 10 years!) and enjoy exploring caf√©s (always on the lookout for the perfect cup of espresso).

I am actively seeking opportunities to apply geospatial data science for real-world impact, whether in environmental sustainability, public policy, civic analytics, or urban development. If you're interested in collaborating or discussing potential opportunities, feel free to connect!
