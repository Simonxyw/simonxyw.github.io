Hi! I’m Xinyu (Simon) Wu, a Master’s student in Data Science at the University of Michigan with a concentration in Spatial Data Analysis. My work sits at the intersection of Geospatial Data Science and Sustainability, where I explore how spatial technologies and data-driven methods can support equitable development and environmental decision-making.

My academic and research journey has led me to:

- Integrate spatial, policy, and agronomic datasets to inform sustainable agriculture and air quality interventions in India.

- Apply machine learning, econometric, and causal inference techniques to evaluate urban form, carbon emissions, and low-carbon policy effectiveness in China.

- Conduct spatiotemporal analyses on public health topics, including COVID-19 transmission dynamics, using advanced statistical and geospatial methods.

I have hands-on experience working with large-scale spatial datasets, machine learning models, and GIS platforms (ArcGIS, Python, SQL), and I am passionate about translating complex data into actionable insights for real-world impact.

Outside of research, I’ve been a devoted Cantopop enthusiast for over a decade. I also love discovering hidden-gem cafés in my free time. (Espresso only!)

I am currently looking for opportunities where I can apply geospatial data science and policy analysis to tackle challenges in sustainability, public policy, urban development, and civic analytics. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect or collaborate!
